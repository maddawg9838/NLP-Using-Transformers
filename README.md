# NLP-Using-Transformers

## Overview
This project performs machine translation from English to Spanish using the [Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-es Model](https://huggingface.co/Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-es) on HuggingFace. Utilizing this model, The Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens is translated into Spanish, and the accuracy is measured by comparing it to a published Spanish version.
