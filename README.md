# NLP-Using-Transformers

## Overview
This project performs machine translation from English to Spanish using the [Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-es Model](https://huggingface.co/Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-es) on HuggingFace. Utilizing this model, The Christmas Carol by Charles Darwin is translated into Spanish, and the accuracy is measured by comparing to a published spanish version. 

## Files
- `CS 4372 Project 4 Report.pdf` - The report covering the topic of transformers and analysis.
- `CS 4372 Project 4.ipynb` - The Google Colab notebook containing the full analysis code.
- `README.md` - This README.

## Instructions
1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Click **File → Upload notebook** and select `CS 4372 Project 4.ipynb`.
3. Make sure you are connected to the GPU runtime.
4. The program takes 3 hours to execute completely; thus, peruse the output before running
5. Run all cells sequentially. All necessary libraries are already imported and installed within the notebook. 

## WARNING: 
This project utilizes transformers and takes approximately 3 hours to execute all iterations with different hyperparameters

Note: The uploaded Google Colab file includes the code and output. Please look at the output before running each cell or running all the cells at once.
